// Demo and Test Instructions for Admin Interface Switching Feature
// =================================================================

/*
ADMIN INTERFACE SWITCHING FEATURE - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
==========================================================

This feature allows admin users to seamlessly switch between admin and user interfaces,
providing them with the ability to experience the app from both perspectives.

KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
========================

1. **AdminViewService** - Core service managing interface state
   - Persistent view mode storage using SharedPreferences
   - Toggle between admin and user views
   - Automatic state management and notifications

2. **Enhanced Profile Screen** - Updated with interface toggle
   - Visual interface mode indicator with color-coded badges
   - Switch button with loading states
   - Real-time view mode feedback
   - Only visible to admin users

3. **Smart Navigation** - Contextual admin access
   - Floating Action Button for quick admin access (only in admin view)
   - Seamless integration with existing navigation
   - Admin controls hidden in user view mode

4. **Persistent Settings** - State preservation
   - User preference saved locally
   - Survives app restarts
   - Reset capabilities

HOW TO TEST:
===========

1. **Setup**:
   - Run the app
   - Create account with email: "eniolaakande04@gmail.com" (auto-admin)
   - Or sign up with any email and manually promote to admin

2. **Access Interface Toggle**:
   - Go to Profile tab
   - Scroll to see "Interface Mode" section (only visible to admins)
   - Current mode displayed with color-coded badge:
     * Red badge = Admin View (full admin features visible)
     * Green badge = User View (admin features hidden)

3. **Test Switching**:
   - Click "Switch" button to toggle views
   - Observe:
     * Badge color and text change
     * Admin sections hide/show in profile
     * Floating admin button appears/disappears in navigation
     * Toast notification confirms switch

4. **Verify User Experience**:
   
   **In Admin View**:
   - Profile shows admin sections
   - Red floating admin button visible on all tabs
   - Full administrative capabilities available
   
   **In User View**:
   - Profile hides admin sections
   - No admin floating button
   - Experience identical to regular user
   - Admin still has admin permissions (just hidden UI)

5. **Test Persistence**:
   - Switch to user view
   - Close and reopen app
   - Verify it remembers user view mode
   - Switch back to admin view to verify it persists

BENEFITS:
========

✅ **User Experience Testing**: Admins can experience the app as regular users
✅ **Interface Debugging**: Easy to spot user vs admin UI differences  
✅ **Content Moderation**: View content from user perspective
✅ **Training & Support**: Understand user workflows for better support
✅ **Development**: Test both interfaces without separate accounts

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
=======================

- **State Management**: Provider pattern with AdminViewService
- **Persistence**: SharedPreferences for local storage
- **UI Responsiveness**: Consumer widgets for reactive updates
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead with efficient state management
- **Security**: UI hiding only - permissions remain intact

ADMIN EMAIL: eniolaakande04@gmail.com
=====================================
This email is automatically granted admin privileges upon account creation.

// Usage Example:
/*

// In any widget that needs to check admin view mode:
Consumer<AdminViewService>(
  builder: (context, adminViewService, child) {
    if (adminViewService.isAdminViewEnabled) {
      // Show admin features
      return AdminWidget();
    } else {
      // Show user interface
      return UserWidget();
    }
  },
)

// To toggle programmatically:
final adminViewService = Provider.of<AdminViewService>(context, listen: false);
await adminViewService.toggleAdminView();

// To check current state:
final isAdminView = adminViewService.isAdminViewEnabled;
final currentMode = adminViewService.currentViewMode; // "Admin View" or "User View"
